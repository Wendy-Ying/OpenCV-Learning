# OpenCV-Learning

I taught myself OpenCV during my preparation for the competition, containing:

### Simple task
- Color Recognition
- Denoising
- Edge Detection
- Stencil Matching
- Hough Line Detection
- Hough Circle Detection
- Corner Point Detection
- SIFT Feature Point Matching
- Auto Tracking

### Complex task
- Bank Card Number Recognition - Morphology Extraction & Template Matching
- Text Scanning OCR Recognition - Edge Detection & Coordinate Point Transmission Transformation
- Panorama stitching - descriptor matching
- Portrait keying - background masking

### Competetion task in the past
- Red Circle Recognition - Color Threshold Segmentation & Hough Circle Detection
- 2D Code Recognition - Transmission Transform
- Barcode Location Recognition - Morphological Operation Extraction Segmentation
- Start and Landing Point Detection - Template Matching
- Fire source recognition - color mask
